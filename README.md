# Varnish-Wordpress-VCL
This VCL can be used with Wordpress when you do not have a plugin that purges content.

With this VCL file for Wordpress websites you should get higher cache hit and better latency results.

This is only for Varnish version 3.x , it will not work for Varnish 4.x because the VCL synthax changed.
